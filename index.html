                <h2>Starting out: The Ferry and Whale Watching</h2>

                <p>We set off on our journey around 4am, to catching the 8:15 ferry from Port Angeles. The ferry ride started out foggy, but it cleared up the closer we got to Victoria.</p>

                <p>After arriving, we headed to our hotel to drop off our luggage and killed time by walking along the waterfront. We headed in the direction of the Fisherman's Wharf, to kill time, and also because we'd set up whale watching tour at 3pm.</p>

                <p>After eating at Fisherman's Wharf, we checked-in with our tour and the captain let us know the plan for the trip. There had been orca sightings earlier in the day, so he was hopeful the luck would continue for our tour. We all boarded the ship and set sail.</p>

                <p>The trip was set to take 3 hours and the first 30-45 minutes was just about us finding the correct location. After a while, we noticed a bunch of other boats, all centered around one specific location. It looks like we had found what we were after.</p>

                <p>Our second day in Victoria, we decided to try out ziplining. We had done it once before, in Las Vegas, but this one was a proper zipline tour. We made our way out to Sooke, about 40 minutes away from downtown Victoria.
