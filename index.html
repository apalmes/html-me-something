                <h2>Starting out: The Ferry and Whale Watching</h2>

                <p>My girlfriend and I set off on our journey around 4am, to catch the 8:15am ferry from Port Angeles. The ferry ride started out foggy but it cleared up the closer we got to Victoria.</p>

                <p>After arriving, we headed to our hotel to drop off our luggage and started exploring along the waterfront. We headed in the direction of the Fisherman's Wharf because we had a whale watching tour at 3pm.</p>

                <p>After eating at Fisherman's Wharf, we checked-in with our tour and the captain let us know the plan for the trip. There had been orca sightings earlier in the day so he was hopeful the luck would continue for our tour. We all boarded the ship and set sail!</p>

                <p>The trip was set to take 3 hours and the first 30-45 minutes was just about us finding the correct location. After a while, we noticed a bunch of other boats all centered around one specific location. It looks like we had found what we were after!</p>

                <h2>Day 2: Ziplining, the Royal BC Museum, and Kayaking!</h2>
                <figure>

                <p>Our second day in Victoria, we decided to try out ziplining. We tried it once before in Las Vegas, but this one was a proper zipline tour. We made our way out to Sooke, about 40 minutes away from downtown Victoria.</p>
                
                <figure>
                <img src="images/1000ft.jpg" alt="The view from the top of the 1000ft line" />

                <figcaption class='captions'>It may not look like much, but this is the starting point of their fastest line.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The tour itself takes about 2 hours to complete. It is 8 separate lines, ranging from 150 feet to 1,000 feet long. After you complete the first line, there's no turning back, the only way down is by completing the course.</p>
                <p>The views were breathtaking and our guides did a fantastic job keeping us safe, and also showing us different ways to ride the lines. (My personal favorite was the &quot;Spiderman&quot;) </p>

                <p>After our ziplining tour we made our way back to Victoria and headed to the Royal BC Museum.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Their Natural History Exhibits were very impressive. They had several rooms that represented different regions.</p>
                <p>There was also a very interesting exhibit about Modern History which had entire rooms set up as if they were a time capsule from the past.</p>

                <p>After running out of time exploring the museum, we made our way to the waterfront to start our kayak tour.</p>

                <p>Our tour lead us out from the Inner Harbour and up the Gorge Waterway. We got to see a few Great Blue Heron and another Harbour seal.</p>

            <h2>Day 3: Miniature World and the Ferry Home</h2>
            <p>Our last day in Victoria was rainy, so we decided to check out Miniature World. It's a very interesting place that has miniature displays that show off both historical events and fictional worlds.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="images/minitown.jpg" alt="Miniature Town" />
            <figcaption class='captions'>Collage of one of the miniature towns</figcaption>

            <figcaption class='captions'>A wider shot, zoomed in to show the details</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure> 
            <img src="images/fair.jpg" alt="Miniature Fair" />
            <figcaption class="captions">Miniature Fair!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In all honesty, the pictures don't do the displays justice. They are all very impressively detailed, and a few, like the fair, have moving parts to represent the actual motion of the amusement rides. It also has a day/night cycle to show off the colorful lights you'd expect if you were to visit at night. It was a fun way to spend a rainy last day in Victoria.</p> 
            <p>After visiting for a while we made our way back to the hotel, collected our belongings, and headed to the ferry terminal. This was a very fun way to spend the Memorial Day Weekend.</p>
